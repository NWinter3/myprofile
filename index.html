      <h1>Personal Information</h1>
      <p>I’m Australian born and raised and come from a family of 5 with me being the youngest. have an older sister; Olivia and an older brother; Mackenzie and a toy poodle named Jed. My dad’s side of the family is primarily German and my mum;s side is a mix of many European countries including France, Germany and England.

        <p>I was born in Cranbourne but don’t remember living there because I was too young. I went to Holy Spirit Community School in Ringwood from prep to grade 2 then I moved to Officer and finished my primary schooling at St Patrick’s Pakenham. I then went to school at St Francis Xavier completing year 7 to 9 at the Officer campus and then finishing year 10 to 12 at the Beaconsfield campus.</p>

        <p>I really only can speak English however I did learn a bit of Italian at primary school and I studied Japanese from year 7 to 12 and I’m planning on studying German as I feel it would be interesting to go to Germany someday and would want to be able to speak the native language. Fun fact about myself, I have been obsessed with video games ever since I got a game boy when I was about 5 or 6 years old and then moved on to the original Xbox, Xbox 360 and so on and so on.</p>

      <h1>My Interest in IT</h1>
      <p>My interest with IT started pretty much the same time that my interest with video games began which as said before started around 5 or 6 years old. While I don’t think IT and video games necessarily go hand in hand I think that there is a bit of a correlation. I’ve always found messing around with computers to be fun and interesting and I think my interest in IT specifically started when I started modding Skyrim and then later other games too. I mainly began when I had to learn how parts of a game load and when so that I could organise and fix mod load order issues. My interest I think indirectly grew because I’m probably the one in my family that is the most tech savvy so whenever there is a problem with someone's computer or the internet everyone runs to me to fix it for them even if I don’t know what's going on. I think because of that I sort of studied and learnt things to do with IT out of necessity because I was the only one in my family that could understand what was going on or to follow what people online say would fix it.</p>

        <p>Since then doing IT classes, software development classes and programming classes at school kept my interest in IT alive and became something that I enjoyed and could see myself doing in the future very early. So in year 10 when I decided to myself that this would be what I wanted to do I searched online for courses and found many different courses from different institutes and it was quite overwhelming. But after sitting down and really looking at each course and institute I decided that RMIT was one of the top universities I wanted to go to. First it has institute of technology in the name which was sort of a no brainer but also the reputation and representation of the university was very positive and it became a place that I really wanted to study at. But also the feedback I had heard from my siblings friends who went to RMIT was very positive and made me want to go as well. And to be honest, the fact that the train station is only 1 to 2 minute walk away from campus did interest the more lazy side of me. I expect to learn the skills required for me to get into the workforce as quickly as possible and in particular hope to expand my knowledge on programming. I personally find programming to be very fun and interesting so I hope I can further my knowledge and skills in different programming languages and am excited to learn programming languages that are used frequently in the workforce now such as C#, C++ and Swift. However I do also like other sides of IT such as security and networking as I have spent a lot of time outside of school learning and trying to understand both topics and hopefully I can learn more so that I could apply those skills in the workforce.</p>

      <h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
      <p>After some searching on Seek.com, I came across this job advertisement (attached via pdf). I personally find this job very appealing as the requirements seem very achievable, the pay is very good and overall is a position I would enjoy and want to be in. I find programming very fun, enjoyable and one of the only things work-related that I can get very into and have a strong self-motivation for which makes any programmer heavy position look very appealing to me. I also love video games as mentioned in my about me so working in the games industry would be absolutely amazing and something that I would thoroughly enjoy. For the position I am going to need a bachelor of computer science or equivalent, knowledge of C++, 5+ years of game development experience and knowledge of other languages can be useful such as Python. I’ll be getting the experience in programming in languages like Python through me classes in this program. I’ll also be getting my Bachelor which is equivalent to a computer science degree. I’ll be learning Unity during my project this semester and I also am intending to make some games with Unity in my own time. I intend to get a more entry level job in game development after I graduate so that I can build up my experience in the industry and improve my skills in regards to working in a team and other things such as other programming languages and practises that I would learn indirectly while working.

    <h1>My Profile</h1>
    <p>On the Myers Briggs 16 personalities test, I got the Mediator (INFP-T). The results of the test showed that I am quite shy and not very talkative but when I am comfortable I try to build deep close relationships and do have a lot to say. I also know from my results that I am extremely empathetic and despite being shy, I subconsciously try to be close to people and build relationships. From this, I believe that in group work it is important for me to know and truly understand the people I’m working with and it would be detrimental to my work to not be close to my co-workers. I also understand that I also have strong self-doubts and usually take a backseat and instead support others rather than being confident in myself, my abilities and my ideas. I feel that I can alleviate this by getting to know the members of my group on a more personal level so that I can make myself more comfortable in myself in those group scenarios. From this as well, when forming a group it will be beneficial if there are members who are more outgoing and fulfil a more leadership/group management role so that it will be easier for me and other members to get to know each other in a more natural and less forced way
</p>
<p>From the Big Five Personality test I can see some things about me that could impact me and my group in group work. Firstly I am quite pessimistic, which may be good when considering constructive criticism but it may also be a downfall as I may find myself being overwhelmed with negative thoughts and decide to give up. This shows me that I need to be better at self regulation but also that optimism from other group members may help alleviate my pessimism. I can see from my score in openness I can be quite good at boosting the morale of others and possibly make others be able to do better. It also indicates to me that despite my shyness I can be quite a team player. However due to my low scores in extraversion and conscientiousness my ability to be out there and outgoing can be difficult for me and my ability to self discipline can be lacking. From this I can see that despite some qualities that I have that show myself to be a good leader, my inability to be outgoing and my tendency to procrastinate would mean that it would be ideal if I had someone to oversee or be a leader/boss to me so that I could still get the most out of my personal abilities while making up for my weaknesses
</p>
<p>From my results of my learning style preference test I can determine that while I am quite multimodal with my learning style, kinesthetic and reading can be more useful to me. This shows me that rather than listening to people telling me information or looking at tools such as graphs, it would be more beneficial for me to read the information myself and put that knowledge to the test by messing around and maybe attempting to recall the information and write it up for myself. I can also say from past experience, that teaching others the information I have learnt has helped solidify my understanding and knowledge and has helped me remember the content that I learn</p>

    <h1>My Project Idea</h1>
    <p>My project idea is a video game made using Unity. My general idea for the game will be a story driven game that attempts to break the norms of video game structure and applies it to real life. My idea was inspired by the video game Undertale made by Scott Fox, which is a game that uses generic game mechanics like levelling up and puts a more realistic and dark twist to it to make players think more about their decisions in the game and to make the game itself feel more realistic.

My motivation for this project is a mix between my own personal interests and my interest to better the public image of video games and their effects on people. Many people in todays society find video games to be violent, appealing to negative fantasies and to have negative effects on children's development. My way of addressing these issues will be to make a game where norms in other games such as killing to level up will be more frowned upon and be shown in a different light.

My intention will be to make the game feel more real and to make players develop connections to the characters and the world and in doing so incentivise players to be more peaceful and to go about the problems in the game without just running in and killing to progress. My game will be heavily story driven where the player will be in a dystopian world where they find themselves surrounded by familiar beast like creatures yet they all seem to share human like brains and personalities. While some of these creatures will be friendly, many will want to kill the player because the king has a strong hate for humans. It will be up to the player to decide whether they will be violent or a pacifist, and the game will support a good path, a bad path and a neutral path all leading to different conclusions to the story. The game will follow a linear story path and will have many locations consisting of a mixture of friendly npcs, store owners and enemies. Each location will end with a boss fight that will need to be completed to progress to the next area. This pattern will continue until the player reaches the final boss fight which will slightly alter based on the players actions. If the player has followed the neutral path (killing some creatures but not actively seeking to kill all of them) they will be forced to fight and kill the final boss and their option to spare them will be removed. They will then experience an end sequence where they are judged by the npcs they have both met on their journey both dead and alive and the player will be hinted at to complete the game while being a pacifist. Playing the game as a pacifist will result in the player having to learn about the other creatures personalities and generally will challenge the player with the most difficult version of the game, completing sections while being a pacifist will result in different scenes some of which will be boss fights and will also make the final boss the most difficult he can be. The game will end with a secret fight where the player will have to show their understanding of their friends they have made on their journey and rely on them to help them beat the game. This will result in the most happy ending for the player and will hopefully provide a good conclusion to the game and its characters. However if the player goes out of their way to kill every single creature in the game, they will go down the dark path where many of the norms from the normal version of the game will be broken such as previous bosses dying very easily, short cuts in areas being done for you and not having to buy items. This is intended to have a very jarring experience to potentially make the player regret their choices and maybe even creep them out due to the eerie nature of the path. This version of the game will be mechanically the easiest to complete however morally, ethical and philosophically the hardest.

To make this game I’ll need the software Unity and will need a decent computer to develop it. I may also need storage devices (physical or cloud) so that I can give versions of the game to people to test and give feedback on. I’ll need to use my laptop to test how the game runs on a less powerful machine. For hardware, I have a gaming computer at home I can use for development and testing, I have my laptop that I can use to test the game for performance issues. I’ll need to download Unity to use during development and if I intend to distribute the game for testing I’ll need to buy storage devices or upload the game to the cloud using something like dropbox.

If the project is successful I may be able to publish the game online whether it is for free or not. My intention would be to get some form of attention specifically from those who view video games as wholly negative to society. My goal is to make not only my video game but other video games appear as a more normal medium for story telling and interactive experiences for people to enjoy and learn from. I hope that with my game I can make people view video games as a tool for teaching lessons (for my game as example: the easy path isn’t usually the most ideal, to care for others, etc) and to tell great stories in a way for players to feel directly connected to the world and their actions in them rather than following a protagonist in a movie or book whos actions and feelings are separate from the viewer/reader. I could also potentially use my game if it is successful as a tool to show my expertise in game development, story writing and project management for future hiring opportunities.
