      <h1>Personal Information</h1>
      <p>I’m Australian born and raised and come from a family of 5 with me being the youngest. have an older sister; Olivia and an older brother; Mackenzie and a toy poodle named Jed. My dad’s side of the family is primarily German and my mum;s side is a mix of many European countries including France, Germany and England. I was born in Cranbourne but don’t remember living there because I was too young. I went to Holy Spirit Community School in Ringwood from prep to grade 2 then I moved to Officer and finished my primary schooling at St Patrick’s Pakenham. I then went to school at St Francis Xavier completing year 7 to 9 at the Officer campus and then finishing year 10 to 12 at the Beaconsfield campus. I really only can speak English however I did learn a bit of Italian at primary school and I studied Japanese from year 7 to 12 and I’m planning on studying German as I feel it would be interesting to go to Germany someday and would want to be able to speak the native language. Fun fact about myself, I have been obsessed with video games ever since I got a game boy when I was about 5 or 6 years old and then moved on to the original Xbox, Xbox 360 and so on and so on.

      <h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
      <p>My interest with IT started pretty much the same time that my interest with video games began which as said before started around 5 or 6 years old. While I don’t think IT and video games necessarily go hand in hand I think that there is a bit of a correlation. I’ve always found messing around with computers to be fun and interesting and I think my interest in IT specifically started when I started modding Skyrim and then later other games too. I mainly began when I had to learn how parts of a game load and when so that I could organise and fix mod load order issues. My interest I think indirectly grew because I’m probably the one in my family that is the most tech savvy so whenever there is a problem with someone's computer or the internet everyone runs to me to fix it for them even if I don’t know what's going on. I think because of that I sort of studied and learnt things to do with IT out of necessity because I was the only one in my family that could understand what was going on or to follow what people online say would fix it. Since then doing IT classes, software development classes and programming classes at school kept my interest in IT alive and became something that I enjoyed and could see myself doing in the future very early. So in year 10 when I decided to myself that this would be what I wanted to do I searched online for courses and found many different courses from different institutes and it was quite overwhelming. But after sitting down and really looking at each course and institute I decided that RMIT was one of the top universities I wanted to go to. First it has institute of technology in the name which was sort of a no brainer but also the reputation and representation of the university was very positive and it became a place that I really wanted to study at. But also the feedback I had heard from my siblings friends who went to RMIT was very positive and made me want to go as well. And to be honest, the fact that the train station is only 1 to 2 minute walk away from campus did interest the more lazy side of me. I expect to learn the skills required for me to get into the workforce as quickly as possible and in particular hope to expand my knowledge on programming. I personally find programming to be very fun and interesting so I hope I can further my knowledge and skills in different programming languages and am excited to learn programming languages that are used frequently in the workforce now such as C#, C++ and Swift. However I do also like other sides of IT such as security and networking as I have spent a lot of time outside of school learning and trying to understand both topics and hopefully I can learn more so that I could apply those skills in the workforce.
